You authorize CTX to obtain information about you from third parties (including financial institutions and credit reporting agencies), although CTX has no obligation to do so. If you do not provide accurate and complete information during registration or when requesting a Remittance, we have the right to prohibit you from using the Service or the Application or to stop your requested Remittance.

										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Description of the Service.</strong>
										<ol className="inner">
											<li>You may use the Application only to send a Remittance to a Beneficiary located in a country where CTX provides payment service, as designated on the Application from time to time. CTX and CTX-designated service providers will process the remittance and make funds available for receipt by the Beneficiary as described below.</li>
											<li>Your use of the Application or the Service does not constitute or create a fiduciary or escrow capacity between you and CTX. CTX provides a remittance service only; the funds that you direct CTX to pay to your Beneficiary are not held by CTX as a deposit or in escrow, and CTX is not holding or processing your Remittance as a fiduciary. CTX's only obligation is to pay your Remittance to your Beneficiary or to return the principal amount of the Remittance to you.</li>
											<li>The Service is generally available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, although there may be times when the Service is unavailable to you or to your Beneficiary. Periods of unavailability may be caused by CTX's own acts (such as temporary periods when the Service is taken off-line to make upgrades or improvements), or by events beyond CTX's control, such as power outages, telecommunications failures, war or civil unrest, natural disasters or other acts of God. CTX may from time to time set limits on the value of Remittances you may send (both individually and over a period of time), as well as the value of Remittances any Beneficiary may receive. CTX may delay payment of your Remittance to allow CTX to determine that your Remittance complies with applicable law, regulation or CTX policies. CTX has the right, without notice to you, to refuse to accept or pay any Remittance that CTX determines in our sole discretion may violate applicable law, regulation or our policies, including laws, regulations and policies intended to help detect and prevent money-laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other abuses of financial services; if we accept a Remittance and then determine that it may violate any such law, regulation or policy, we may hold the Remittance until such time that the matter is resolved.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Authority to Charge Payment Account; Fees and Expenses.</strong>
										<ol className="inner">
											<li>In order to use the Service, you must use the Application to direct CTX to withdraw the principal value of the Remittance from your Payment Account, plus any applicable fees and charges; by requesting a Remittance, you authorize CTX to charge your Payment Account for the principal amount of the requested Remittance and applicable fees and charges, if any. You acknowledge that CTX has no obligation to process or complete a requested Remittance if CTX is unable for any reason to obtain authorization or settlement of the funds from your Payment Account for the principal amount of the requested Remittance and all applicable fees and charges.</li>
											<li>CTX will disclose its fees and charges for providing the Service to you before you initiate a Remittance. CTX's fees and charges may change from time to time, and may depend, among other factors, on the principal amount of your Remittance, your type of Payment Account, your location, and the location of your Beneficiary. In addition to the fees and charges, CTX will also show you the foreign exchange rate (that is, the rate at which your funds will be converted into the currency to be paid to your Beneficiary) applicable to your Remittance before you send it. CTX's foreign exchange rates change from time to time. In addition to the fees and charges you pay when sending a Remittance, CTX makes money when we convert the currency you send into the currency we pay to your Beneficiary.</li>
											<li>If the charge to your Payment Account is returned, charged-back or canceled for any reason after CTX has processed your Remittance request, you will be responsible to CTX for the principal amount of the Remittance and all associated fees and charges. You agree to pay such amounts, plus any applicable additional service fee and/or a non- sufficient funds (NSF) fee of $20 USD as a result of the return to CTX immediately upon demand. You authorize us to debit your Payment Account for the amount of any of the foregoing amounts.<br/>You may be subject to fees (including a cash advance fee) under your agreement with the bank or other financial institution that issues your debit card when you use such a card for a Remittance. You should review your card agreement regarding such potential fees.</li>
											<li>Although CTX will pay the full principal amount of your Transaction to your Beneficiary in the currency CTX specifies to you when you initiate your Remittance, your Beneficiary may incur costs, fees or charges from his or her bank, mobile phone company, E-Wallet issuer or other party to maintain or withdraw the funds. Furthermore, your Beneficiary's ability to use or withdraw the funds you send may be limited by the terms of your Beneficiary's E-Wallet issuer.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Reliance by CTX.</strong>
										<p>You represent and warrant that all information you enter into the Application or otherwise provide to CTX is true and complete, including information about you, your Payment Account, and your Beneficiary. When processing a Remittance Payment, CTX may rely on the registration information and Remittance information that you provide. You acknowledge that any errors in the information, including misidentification of Beneficiary(s), incorrect or inconsistent account names and numbers, or misspellings, are your responsibility and that CTX shall have no liability for executing a Remittance based upon the inaccurate or incomplete information you provided or entered.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Execution of a Remittance.</strong>
										<p>The CTX Remittance Facility Application is generally available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. <strong>Generally, your Beneficiary is paid instantly through the CTX mobile application; accordingly, once you originate a Remittance, you may be unable to stop or change it.</strong> If ever there is a situation where your transaction is not delivered instantly to the Beneficiary, we will contact you and keep you informed about the delay.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Payment of Funds to Beneficiary.</strong>
										<ol className="inner">
											<li>CTX and/or CTX designated service providers will arrange for the payment of the Remittance to your Beneficiary. CTX reserves the right to select the form of payment to the Beneficiary. CTX and/or CTX designated service providers will use reasonable efforts to provide payment in a form requested, but the CTX Application is not obligated to provide payment options for a specific Payment. Depending on the situation and the availability of various payment options, payment may be made by means of a credit to a mobile wallet, currency (cash), by check, by stored value card, credit to a bank account or credit card account or by some other payment instrument. Not all payment methods are available in all countries, and CTX reserves the right to change payment method options. If a Beneficiary cannot be located and identified, the Remittance Payment funds may be returned to you either by a credit to your Payment Account or by check, at CTX's option.</li>
											<li>CTX reserves the right to establish identification and verification requirements for a Beneficiary to receive a Remittance. CTX may rely, without further investigation, upon identification information or documentation provided by you or a Beneficiary, including any code or identifier number of the Remittance, when paying the Beneficiary. CTX has the right to decline to pay the Beneficiary if CTX cannot verify the identity of the Beneficiary or if CTX believes that you or your Beneficiary may be in violation of this Agreement or any applicable law, regulation or CTX policy. Although CTX has the right to establish identification and verification requirements, and the Beneficiary's failure to comply with them is a basis to decline payment of the Remittance, CTX has no obligation to establish any such requirements.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Foreign Exchange.</strong>
										<ol className="inner">
											<li>Payments to Beneficiaries are generally made in the currency of the Beneficiary's country. If permitted by applicable law and the Application, you may request your Remittance to be paid in another currency approved and made available by CTX from time to time.</li>
											<li>If a currency conversion is required, CTX and/or CTX-designated service providers will convert the currency in which you initiate your Remittance into the local currency at the CTX exchange rate for your Remittance in effect at the time you initiate your Remittance. CTX will disclose the exchange rate to you before you authorize the Remittance. CTX's exchange rates vary from time to time, and may also differ depending on the principal value of your Remittance and other factors. In addition to the fees and charges applicable to your Remittance, CTX makes money when your currency is converted into the currency in which your Remittance is paid.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Permissible Remittance Payments.</strong>
										<p>The Application is not intended for use by any person in any jurisdiction or country where such use would be contrary to law or regulation. Specifically and without limitation, you may not use the Service for any Remittance (a) induced by or involving the proceeds of crime, fraud or other improper activity; (b) exceeding CTX's transaction limits (whether in amount, frequency or otherwise); (c) sent for the purpose of gambling, including placing bets or paying winnings; (d) intended to be used as an escrow or similar capacity for delayed payment; (e) which CTX determines is suspicious or may violate applicable law or regulation, including laws intended to detect and prevent money- laundering, terrorist financing, human trafficking, fraud, or to enforce currency or exchange rate controls. You agree that you will only request a Remittance that complies with this Agreement, applicable origination country laws and applicable laws in the country of the Beneficiary. You may only use the Application to send Remittances on your own behalf. You may not resell the Application or use the Application to make Remittances on behalf of, or as agent for, another person. You will provide information and/or documentation that CTX may request from time to time in order for CTX to comply with any applicable laws, including anti-money laundering laws. CTX may refuse payment of any Remittance which CTX determines in its sole discretion does not comply with applicable law, CTX policy or the terms of this Agreement.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Rejection of Remittance Payment Request.</strong>
										<ol className="inner">
											<li>
												<p>CTX has the right to reject your request for a Remittance, or to decline to complete a request for a Remittance, or to impose a value or frequency limitation on your use of the Service, without cause or prior notice to you. Without limiting the foregoing, CTX may suspend, delay or reject your Remittance Payment request if:</p>
												<ol>
													<li>the value of one or more of your Remittance requests exceed any limits established by CTX;</li>
													<li>CTX is unable to charge your Payment Account for the principal amount of the Remittance and related fees and charges;</li>
													<li>Your Remittance request is incomplete or unclear;</li>
													<li>CTX is unable to confirm your identity or verify any registration or Beneficiary information, including the identity of the Beneficiary;</li>
													<li>CTX suspects fraud or irregularity or illegality;</li>
													<li>Your name or the name of your Beneficiary is a possible match to a name on one or more applicable "watch lists" maintained by governments, inter-governmental groups or CTX to help detect and prevent illegal activity;</li>
													<li>CTX and/or CTX-designated service providers are unable to fulfill your request for any reason.</li>
												</ol>
											</li>
											<li>If your request for a Remittance is declined for any reason, CTX will notify you by an SMS / text message or electronic mail, or by any other reasonable means of notice.</li>
											<li>Generally, if your request for a Remittance is rejected, CTX will return the principal amount of your Remittance to your Payment Account, if it has already been withdrawn; there may be circumstances, however, where the law requires CTX to hold your Remittance or to pay it to another party (including a government agency). If that happens, CTX will inform you, if we are permitted to do so by applicable law. CTX has the right retain any authorized fees and charges it may have imposed in connection with the requested Remittance, even if CTX declines to pay it.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Returns Due to your Mistake.</strong>
										<p>If CTX is unable to complete payment of the Remittance to your Beneficiary because you provided incorrect information about the Beneficiary, such as an incorrect telephone number, an incorrect or misspelled name, the wrong bank or bank account or any other misinformation, you will be liable for any costs, fees, expenses and losses that CTX incurs in returning the Remittance to you, such as processing costs, losses arising due to exchange rate fluctuations and third party service charges.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Limitation of Liability.</strong>
										<p>CTX shall not be responsible for any delay, failure to execute, or an error in the execution of your Remittance request due to circumstances beyond CTX's reasonable control, whether caused by strikes, power failures, equipment malfunctions, war, riots, governmental or court orders, work stoppages or similar occurrences or circumstances. You further agree that that CTX may refuse to process or delay processing any request if it would violate any guideline, rule, policy or regulation of any government authority or funds transfer system.</p>
										<p>Under no circumstances will CTX be liable for damages, whether caused by the negligence of CTX's employees, contractors, agents or others, beyond the sum of ONE THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$1,000.00), in addition to refunding the principal amount of the Remittance and any fees and costs you may have paid to CTX to send it, unless you have contacted CTX before you send your Remittance and have obtained our written agreement to a higher limit on liability. If we agree to a higher limit on liability, we may charge you for it. Under no circumstances will CTX be liable for any incidental, indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages or the like.</p>
										<p><strong>THE APPLICATION AND SERVICE ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. CTX MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OR THE SERVICE. CTX DOES NOT WARRANT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE APPLICATION OR THE ACCURACY, ADEQUACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION RELATED THERETO AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR NON- FUNCTIONALITY OF THE APPLICATION AND THE SERVICE, OR ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY INFORMATION.

									<li>
										<strong>Error Resolution and Cancellation Policy.</strong>
										<p>For error resolution, transaction cancellation, questions, complaints or a written explanation of your rights, contact us at support@changetransact.com.</p>
										<p>Because CTX credits Remittances to Beneficiaries immediately, your Remittances are typically not cancellable or refundable. If you believe that you sent a Remittance in error, you must contact us within thirty (30) minutes after you initiated the Remittance at support@changetransact.com and we will attempt to recall the Remittance, but we may be unable to do so if the Remittance has already been credited to your Beneficiary's account or if your Beneficiary has already withdrawn or moved the funds; if CTX is unable to recall your remittance, CTX will have no liability to you.</p>
										<p>You have a right to dispute errors in your transaction. There is no charge for this service. If you think there is an error, contact us within 180 days and provide your name, contact information, the beneficiary's name, date of transfer, as well as the reason you believe there has been an error. CTX will determine whether an error occurred and will reply to you within 8 weeks (56 days). If CTX was at fault, you will be entitled to a refund or to have the Remittance re-sent free of charge. If no error occurred or CTX was not at fault, you will receive a written notice including the information that CTX relied on to make that determination.</p>
										<p>CTX shall not be liable to you for any loss resulting from CTX's inability to cancel or refund a Remittance Payment. If CTX refunds Remittance Payment funds to you, these funds may be returned to you either by a credit to your Payment Account or by check payment, at CTX's option.</p>
										<p>The following paragraph applies only to Transactions sent from California to a foreign country: <br/>"RIGHT TO REFUND. You, the customer, are entitled to a refund of the money to be transmitted as the result of this agreement if CTX does not forward the money received from you within 10 days of the date of its receipt, or does not give instructions committing an equivalent amount of money to the person designated by you within 10 days of the date of the receipt of the funds from you unless otherwise instructed by you. If your instructions as to when the moneys shall be forwarded or transmitted are not complied with and the money has not yet been forwarded or transmitted, you have a right to a refund of your money. If you want a refund, you must send your written request to support@changetransact.com. If you do not receive your refund, you may be entitled to your money back plus a penalty of up to $1,000 and attorneys' fees pursuant to Section 1810.5 of the California Financial Code."</p>
